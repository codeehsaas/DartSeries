void main(List<String> args) {
  /*
 1. Write a function bool checkIsogram(String entry) {}
  - It should check if the entry string is an Isogram and return true or false
  Call the function with these 2 values (first result be false, 2nd true):
  final sTime = 'evening';
  final sName = 'Dart';

  Isogram is a word in which character repeat
  For example:
   - evening is NOT an Isogram since e and n repeat
  - dart is AN Isogram since no character repeats

- Hint: You can use a Set object to store the characters.
 - If the length is same as the variable, it's NOT an Isogram

 2. Find the count of each character in the string
  - the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog
  - So something like this: {'a: 1, 'c': 1, 'o': 4....}
