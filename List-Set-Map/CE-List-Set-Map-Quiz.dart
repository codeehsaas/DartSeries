void main(List<String> args) {
  /*
 1. Write a function bool checkIsogram(String entry) {}
  - It should check if the entry string is an Isogram and return true or false
  Call the function with these 2 values (first result be false, 2nd true):
  final sTime = 'evening';
  final sName = 'Dart';

  Isogram is a word in which character repeat
  For example:
   - evening is NOT an Isogram since e and n repeat
  - dart is AN Isogram since no character repeats

- Hint: You can use a Set object to store the characters.
 - If the length is same as the variable, it's NOT an Isogram

 2.  Create a snack Map menu like shown below with 1 snack as below:
   -   var snacks = {'Samosa': 2.50}
 - Add 4 more to it:
  - 'Pakora' for 3.0, 'Jalebi' for 4.25, 'Idli' for 5.0, 'Bhaji' for 6.45

  - Next start with a list for orders:
  - Like var orders = ['Idli'];
  - To this list add 3 more orders, 'Pakora', 'Jalebi', 'Chole;
  - We've deliberately added Chole which is not in snacks menu-map.
  - In that case, just print 'Chole is not served here!' when you
    get to it using the for loop.
  - For other items, add it to the total cost for the whole order
  - If the no of items is ordered more than 3, then give a 5% discount
  - in the final total.
  - Show the final cost of the order after any discount (like above)
  - Something like this:
  - Total cost of your 3 order: Rs xy.ab
