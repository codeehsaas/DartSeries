void main(List<String> args) {
  /*
 1. Write a function bool checkIsogram(String entry) {}
  - It should check if the entry string is an Isogram and return true or false
  Call the function with these 2 values (first result be false, 2nd true):
  final sTime = 'evening';
  final sName = 'Dart';

  Isogram is a word in which character repeat
  For example:
   - evening is NOT an Isogram since e and n repeat
  - dart is AN Isogram since no character repeats

- Hint: You can use a Set object to store the characters.
 - If the length is same as the variable, it's NOT an Isogram

 2.  Create a snack Map menu like shown below with 1 snack. Add others to it:
  - 'Pakora' for 3.0, 'Jalebi' for 4.25, 'Idli' for 5.0, 'Bhaji' for 6.45
  var snacks = {'Samosa': 2.50}
  - Next start with a list, say, var orders = ['Idli'];
  - To this list add orders, 'Pakora', 'Jaliebi';
  - Next using a for loop add the total cost for the whole order
  - If the no of items is ordered more than 3, then give a 5% discount
  - Show the final cost of the order after any discount (like above)
