  //Quiz
/*
Create 1 string variable called prodName with value "Pet Leash"
Create 1 double variable called prodPrice with value 15.99
Create 1 variable using var keyword called prodQ
Create 1 variable using var called orderTotal that is prodPrice * prodQuantity.
Print using variable interpolation and expression to output this:

3 orders of Pet Leash cost $48!

Hint: Use $variable and ${expression} to get this output. Use the round() method
of orderTotal to round the cost. Also, note we're trying to print the $ sign!!
So you may need to escape it.
