  Arithmetic Operators
  Write program to convert 55 F to Celsius.
  Use this formula, C = (F - 32) / 1.8
  You've tempF = 55 and you calculate tempC
  Print answer to 1 decimal place like this 55F is 12.777777C:
  Hint - Use the 'fixed' method of double class
  55F = 12.7C

  /*
  Using For Loop
  - Loop from 15 thru <=55 and increase by 10 in each case (hint: i+=10)
  - Using for loop to print calorie intake for ages for these ages:
  - <= 15/2400 (means anything less than or equal to 15 needs 2400 calories)
  - 20<->25/2800 (<-> from 20 till 25...20/25 are included too...needs 2800 cal),
  - 26<->45/2600
  - >45/2400 (Greater than 45 needs 2400 calories)
