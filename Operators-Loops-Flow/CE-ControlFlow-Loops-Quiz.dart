  Write program to convert 55 F to Celsius.
  Use this formula, C = (F - 32) / 1.8
  You've tempF = 55 and you calculate tempC
  Print answer to 1 decimal place like this 55F is 12.777777C:
  Hint - Use the 'fixed' method of double class
  55F = 12.7C

  Using For Loop
  Loop from 0 thru 20 (20 in included <=)
  For each no
   - If it's divisible by 3 & 5 print "Jhatpat Chatpat"
   - If it's divisible by 3 only print "Jhatpat"
   - If it's divisible by 5 only print "Chatpat";
   - If not by 3 or 5, print "Kuch Bhi"
